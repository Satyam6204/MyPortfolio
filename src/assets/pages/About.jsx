                        My name is Satyam Kumar, and I am a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering from Aravali Institute of Technical Studies, Udaipur. I also hold a Diploma in Computer Science Engineering from Jai Polytechnic, Ambala. Currently, I am undergoing training as a Full Stack Java Developer, with four months remaining in my program.

                        I have hands-on experience in web development, having worked on projects like a TODO app, a weather website, a portfolio, and clones of Amazon and Udemy, all available on my GitHub. Additionally, I completed an internship at Jindal Steel and Power in the IT Department, where I developed a web-based Notice Board website.

                        I come from Ranchi, Jharkhand, and my family consists of my father, a farmer, my mother, a nurse, and my younger sister, who is a student. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and dancing alone. I am passionate about technology and continuously strive to enhance my skills in full-stack development
